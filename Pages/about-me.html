<h1>But First, Thanks! </h1>
<p>
	 If you clicked on this link, it means you're interested in getting to know a little bit about me. We'll get there, but I want to take breif second to thank you! Whether you're considering me for a position or just stopped by to say hello &amp; help me with my Google Analytic skills like I pleaded of you on Facebook &amp; Instagram, I want to sincerely thank you for your time! This has been an incredible, interesting experience learning how to code &amp; get started in web development, so it means a lot that you took a few minutes to see what I've been up to! Cheers! 
</p>
	<h1>Let's get to it. . .</h1>
		<p>
			I think it's a unique &amp; amazing opportunity for developers to be able to showcase our skills &amp; personality in the same breath, so I'm taking advantage! 
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm gonna be frank with you... no I'm not, I'm gonna be Alexa... I enjoy dry humor. I'm generally uncaptivating, though confident &amp; very happy. I have some interesting stories, but lead a pretty casual life. My boyfriend, friends &amp; family are truly the greatest. I get asked in every application what my "spirit animal" is? I'm not a fan of this question, but I'll go with shark because I love them. Plus, have you ever seen that thing the divers do when they turn them over and make them comatose? That's me when I sleep.
		</p>
	<h1>Fun Facts.</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>I have been stung by a scorpian 4 times. One was in my bed at a cabin, which stung me 3 times. The other I stepped on in Mexico. I don't recommend this experience.</li>
			<li>I played softball for a long time &amp; pitched in college before my arm <em>like</em> literally imploded. Okay, not literally. </li>
			<li>I know every single word to <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckNuJuO_N2w">"Boom"</a></i> by Bloodhound Gang &amp; Vanilla Ice &amp; also <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QctoD57aYqw">"The Prayer"</a></i> by Celine Dion &amp; Andrea Bocelli. That's pretty much the spectrum for my taste in music.</li>
			<li>My dog Henry gets free stuff constantly because he's pretty. Tacos, pup cups, donuts, bacon, burritos. "Uh why yes, he LOVES beefy 5-layered burritos." <em>*crosses fingers &amp; tallies up my lunch*</em></li>
			<li> I picked up web development on a whim after I got bored after graduation &amp; wanted to learn something. I bought Jon Duckett's <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Web-Design-HTML-JavaScript-jQuery/dp/1118907442/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=J6S9JA6HJE9J56G9XBC0">HTML &amp; CSS book</a></i> and read it front to back. And the rest is... constantly evolving. I am beyond excited about what's to come. </li>
			<li>I am extremely goal oriented, always have been, &amp; 2018 holds my biggest goals yet.</li>
